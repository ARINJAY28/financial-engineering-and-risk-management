**question 1. Assume b=0.05 is a constant for all i in the BDT model as we assumed in the video lectures. Calibrate the ai parameters so that the model term-structure matches the market term-structure. Be sure that the final error returned by Solver is at most 10−8. (This can be achieved by rerunning Solver multiple times if necessary, starting each time with the solution from the previous call to Solver.

Once your model has been calibrated, compute the price of a payer swaption with notional $1M that expires at time t=3 with an option strike of 0. You may assume the underlying swap has a fixed rate of 3.9% and that if the option is exercised then cash-flows take place at times t=4,…,10. (The cash-flow at time t=i is based on the short-rate that prevailed in the previous period, i.e. the payments of the underlying swap are made in arrears?


**question 2.  Repeat the previous question but now assume a value of b=0.1?


**question 3. Construct a n=10-period binomial model for the short-rate, ri,j. The lattice parameters are: r0,0=5%, u=1.1, d=0.9 and q=1−q=1/2. This is the same lattice that you constructed in Assignment 5.
Assume that the 1-step hazard rate in node (i,j) is given by hij=abj−i2 where a=0.01 and b=1.01. Compute the price of a zero-coupon bond with face value F=100 and recovery R=20%?


**question 4.The true price of 5 different defaultable coupon paying bonds with non-zero recovery are specified in worksheet Calibration in the workbook Assignment5_cds.xlsx. The interest rate is r=5% per annum. Calibrate the six month hazard rates A6 to A16 to by minimizing the SumError ensuring that the term structure of hazard rates are non-decreasing. You can model the non-decreasing
hazard rates by adding constraints of the form A6≤A7,…,A15≤A16. Report the hazard rate at time 0 as a percentage?


**question 5.Modify the data on the CDSpricing worksheet in the workbook bonds_and_cds.xlsx to compute a par spread in basis points for a 5yr CDS with notional principal N=10 million assuming that the expected recovery rate R=25%, the 3-month hazard rate is a flat 1%, and the interest rate is 5% per annum?
